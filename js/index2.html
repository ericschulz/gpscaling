		     <p><b>Overview:</b></p>
			 <ul>
			    <li>You will repeatedly choose between two dots, one green and one red, that fit into a cloud of dots forming a pattern.</li>
			    <li>There will be 200 trials in total. On every trial, you can gain time points. Time points will later be exchanged to a monetary bonus. Your goal is to earn as many time points as possible by choosing the best fitting dot as quickly as possible. The best fitting dot is the one that better matches with the pattern that has been produced by all other dots.</li>
			    <li>Which dot you choose is up to you, but one of them fits better with the underlying pattern of all dots. Note that which dot fits better can change on every trial.</li>
			    <li>You can choose a dot by pressing the 'O' or the 'P' key. The green dot is selected by pressing 'O'; the red dot is selected by pressing 'P'.</li>
			    <li>You will gain time points for every correct choice. You will gain more time points, the faster you choose the correct dot. If you chose the incorrect dot, you will not gain time points.</li>
			    <li>At the end of the experiment, you will see how much money you have earned. The total amount will depend on how often you chose correct dots as well as how quickly you chose them, as indicated by your average time points. Your average time points will be converted into money, and you will receive 4 Cents for every time point. You will be paid $2.00 and a performance-dependent bonus of up to $4.00.</li>

					    <li>After 1 second, a vertical line appears and two dots, a red and a green one, are placed on that line. It is your task to choose the better fitting dot, that is the dot that better matches with the overall pattern, as quickly as possible. You can choose the green dot by pressing 'O'. You can choose the red dot by pressing 'P'.</li>
